        <h1>Likes & Dislikes</h1>
        <p>I absolutely love music, some of my current favorite artists are King Krule, Fleet Foxes, Good Morning, Her's , and Summer Salt!</p>
        <p>Although I am very open about music, I tend to dislike country...go figure!</p>
        <p>I also love to read- some of my favoirte works include <i>Walden</i> by Henry David Thoreau, <i>Invisible Man</i> by Ralph Ellison, and <i>Siddartha</i> by Hermann Hesse.</p>
        <p>I don't like soda! I never drank it as a kid and avoid it today. I guess I never really felt any need and water is tasty anyway!</p>
